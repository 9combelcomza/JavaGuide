One of the advantages of this book is that it offers a variety of exercises and activities that cater to different learning styles and preferences. For example, some exercises are based on listening or reading texts, while others are based on speaking or writing tasks. Some exercises are individual, while others are pair or group work.

The book is designed to be engaging and motivating for students, with colorful illustrations, authentic texts, and interesting topics.
 
However, this book also has some drawbacks that might limit its effectiveness. For instance, some exercises might be too easy or too difficult for some students, depending on their level and progress. Some exercises might also be too repetitive or boring for some students, especially if they have already done similar ones in the course book or the workbook. Some exercises might also require additional materials or equipment that might not be available or accessible for some students, such as a CD player, a computer, or an internet connection. The book might also be too expensive for some students, especially if they have to buy it separately from the course package.
 
In conclusion, **New English File Pre-Intermediate Test Book 56** is a useful and comprehensive test book that can help students improve their English skills and prepare them for various exams. However, it might not be suitable or appealing for all students, depending on their level, needs, goals, and preferences. Therefore, before buying this book, it is advisable to check the contents and sample pages online or in a bookstore, and to consult with your teacher or classmates.
  
If you decide to buy this book, you will find that it has some features that can enhance your learning experience. For example, the book has a learning record that allows you to track your progress and achievements. The book also has dyslexic-friendly reading texts that are specially adapted for students with dyslexia. The book also has a key with answers and explanations for all the exercises and tests. The book also has a glossary with definitions and examples for all the words and phrases that appear in the book.
 
However, you should also be aware that this book is not a substitute for a teacher or a class. The book is meant to be a supplement and a support for your learning, but it cannot replace the guidance and feedback that a teacher can provide. The book is also not a guarantee for exam success. The book can help you practice and improve your skills, but it cannot ensure that you will pass any exam. The book is also not a complete course. The book is focused on testing and revision, but it does not cover all the aspects and skills of the English language.
 
Therefore, if you want to make the most of this book, you should use it in combination with other resources and methods. For example, you should use the book along with the course book and the workbook of the **English File Pre-Intermediate** series. You should also use the book with the study link that provides audio and video resources that complement the book. You should also use the book with a teacher or a tutor who can help you with any doubts or difficulties that you might have. You should also use the book with other sources of English input and output, such as books, magazines, websites, podcasts, movies, songs, games, etc.
 
In summary, **New English File Pre-Intermediate Test Book 56** is a valuable and comprehensive test book that can help you improve your English skills and prepare you for various exams. However, it is not a perfect or sufficient resource for your learning. You should use it wisely and creatively, and always seek for more opportunities to learn and practice English.
