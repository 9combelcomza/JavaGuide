## Step 2: Download the V-Ray for SketchUp installer for Mac
 
Once you are logged in, you will see a page with a list of products that you can download for free trial. Find V-Ray for SketchUp and click on "Download". You will be asked to choose your operating system and SketchUp version. Select "Mac OS" and the version of SketchUp that you have installed on your computer. Then, click on "Download Installer" and save the file to your preferred location.
 
The installer file is a .dmg file that contains the V-Ray application and the Chaos License Server. The file size is about 600 MB, so it may take some time to download depending on your internet speed.
 
## Step 3: Install V-Ray for SketchUp and the Chaos License Server on your Mac
 
After downloading the installer file, double-click on it to open it. You will see a window with two icons: V-Ray for SketchUp and Chaos License Server. Drag both icons to the Applications folder on your Mac. This will copy the files to your Applications folder and install them on your computer.
 
To complete the installation, you need to run both applications once. First, open the Applications folder and find V-Ray for SketchUp. Double-click on it and wait for it to launch. You may see a warning message that says "V-Ray for SketchUp.app can't be opened because it is from an unidentified developer". This is normal and you can bypass it by right-clicking on the app icon and choosing "Open". Then, click on "Open" again in the pop-up window that appears.
 
V-Ray for SketchUp will open and you will see a welcome screen with some information about the software. You can close this window by clicking on the "X" button at the top right corner.
