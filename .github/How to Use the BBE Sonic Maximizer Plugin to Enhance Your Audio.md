The BBE Sonic Maximizer plugin works by applying two processes to your audio signal: a phase correction and a dynamic equalization. The phase correction adjusts the timing and phase relationships of the harmonics in different frequency bands, which helps to counteract the phase smearing effect caused by loudspeakers. The dynamic equalization boosts or cuts the high and low frequencies depending on the level of the audio signal, which adds more brightness and depth to your sound.
  
The BBE Sonic Maximizer plugin is very easy to use, as it only has three knobs: Process, Lo Contour and Output. The Process knob controls the amount of enhancement applied to your audio, from 0% (bypass) to 100% (maximum). The Lo Contour knob adjusts the bass level separately, so you can balance it with the enhanced high end. The Output knob sets the output gain of the plugin, which you can use to match the level of the bypassed signal.
  
The BBE Sonic Maximizer plugin is compatible with Windows DirectX VST and Mac VST hosts, and it can run as a mono or stereo plugin. You can use it on any audio source, such as vocals, guitars, drums, keyboards, synths, mixes and more. You can also use it on individual tracks or on the master bus for a global enhancement.
  
To use the BBE Sonic Maximizer plugin, you need to download it from the BBE Sound website[^1^] and install it on your computer. You will also need a serial number to activate it. Once installed, you can load it as a plugin in your DAW of choice and start tweaking the knobs until you find the sound you like.
  
The BBE Sonic Maximizer plugin is a great tool for adding some sparkle and punch to your audio tracks. It can make your sound more lively, clear and professional without adding any harshness or distortion. Try it out today and hear the difference for yourself!

You can also use the Output knob to adjust the level of the processed signal.
- **Drums:** You can use the BBE Sonic Maximizer plugin to add some crispness and depth to your drum tracks, whether they are live or programmed. Try using a low amount of Process (around 20%) and a high amount of Lo Contour (around 50%) to enhance the low end and transients of your drum sound. You can also use the Output knob to adjust the level of the processed signal.
- **Mixes:** You can use the BBE Sonic Maximizer plugin to add some overall brightness and warmth to your mixes, whether they are stereo or multitrack. Try using a medium amount of Process (around 40%) and a medium amount of Lo Contour (around 30%) to balance the high and low frequencies of your mix.

## Tips and Tricks for Using the BBE Sonic Maximizer Plugin
  
The BBE Sonic Maximizer plugin is a powerful tool that can improve your audio quality, but it also requires some care and attention to avoid overdoing it or causing unwanted side effects. Here are some tips and tricks for using it effectively:

- **Use your ears:** The best way to find the optimal settings for your audio source is to use your ears and listen carefully to the difference between the processed and bypassed signals. Don't rely on the numbers or presets, as they may not suit your specific needs or preferences.
- **Use moderation:** The BBE Sonic Maximizer plugin can be very tempting to crank up, as it can make your audio sound more exciting and lively. However, too much enhancement can also make your audio sound unnatural, harsh or distorted. Use moderation and avoid extreme settings, unless you are going for a special effect.
- **Use automation:** The BBE Sonic Maximizer plugin can be automated in your DAW, which means you can change its settings over time according to your audio material. This can be useful for creating dynamic changes in your audio, such as increasing the Process during a chorus or decreasing the Lo Contour during a bridge.
- **Use parallel processing:** The BBE Sonic Maximizer plugin can be used in parallel with your original audio signal, which means you can blend them together using a mixer or a send/return configuration. This can be useful for creating subtle enhancements or adding some coloration without affecting the original signal too much.

The BBE Sonic Maximizer plugin is a versatile and easy-to-use plugin that can help you achieve better audio quality in your projects. By applying a phase correction and a dynamic equalization to your audio signal, it can restore its natural clarity, definition and punch. You can use it on any audio source, such as vocals, guitars, drums, mixes and more. You can also use it in various ways, such as on individual tracks or on the master bus, as well as in serial or parallel processing. Try it out today and see how it can improve your sound!
